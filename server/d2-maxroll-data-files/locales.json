Many adventurers have traveled this way since the recent troubles began.\n\nNo doubt you've heard about the tragedy that befell the town of Tristram. Some say that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, walks the world again.\n\nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark Wanderer did travel this route a few weeks ago. He was headed east to the mountain pass guarded by the Rogue Monastery.\n\nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to have trailed in his wake. You see, shortly after the Wanderer went through, the Monastery's Gates to the pass were closed and strange creatures began ravaging the countryside.\n\nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the gates are re-opened, I'll remain here with my caravan. I hope to leave for Lut Gholein before the shadow that fell over Tristram consumes us all.  If you're still alive then, I'll take you along.\n\nYou should talk to Akara, too.

I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night -- always something about 'the East'.\n\nOne day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were slain, and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.\n\nI believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.\n\nI fear even worse, my friend...

They have forged deeply into the Barbarian homelands, heading directly for the summit of Mount Arreat!\n\nBaal knows, mortal hero!
